# LearnToCode-DiscordBot
  Its time to get serious, make a discord bot, helping people to learn how to code, like on those "Silicon Valley" discords, that also teach people to code, but no messing around, this is real stuff. No jokes. Professionalism at best. Only humor you'll find is in the easy-to-understand examples.
## How its done
  Its a discord bot, so why not use Discord.JS. Its simple and lightweight on text, and it's all over the place. Anyone can look up a Discord.JS tutorial and be a pro in no time. Come on, if you want to help, boot up your IDE and Get open the Github Desktop app. We'll get rolling in no time.
## Help us out
  If you don't know how to code, but see something that would be a great addition, just open a branch and in the commands file, create a `.js` file named after the coding language, and we'll be sure to pick it up.
  Don't want to wait for us to finish? Hop on youtube and open some tutorials. You can always come back and help us out by commenting out the basics of the language. If you can't make your own branch, simply fork the project and code there. Kindly also [go to our discord](https://discord.gg/3fgH2ff), here you can find the original bot itself, named `LearnToCode#8744`. Our human friends would nicely help you the best they can if you need more help than the bot can give you. You can also become one of those friends yourself.
## Thank you.
  We have no donations page, but you can always join the discord [Here](https://discord.gg/3fgH2ff), and share this amazing project, along with its community, with all of your friends. Seriously, it means a lot if you share this project. So give us a reason to smile.
