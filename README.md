# LearnToCode-DiscordBot
  Its time to get serious, make a discord bot, helping people to learn how to code, like on those "Silicon Valley" discords, that also teach people to code, but no messing around, this is real stuff. No jokes. Professionalism at best. Only humor you'll find is in the easy-to-understand examples.
## How its done
  Its a discord bot, so why not use Discord.JS. Its simple and lightweight on text, and it's all over the place. Anyone can look up a Discord.JS tutorial and be a pro in no time. Come on, if you want to help, boot up your IDE and Get open the Github Desktop app. We'll get rolling in no time.
## Help us out
  If you don't know how to code, but see something that would be a great addition, just open a branch and in the commands file, create a `.js` file named after the coding language, and we'll be sure to pick it up.
  Don't want to wait for us to finish? Hop on youtube and open some tutorials. You can always come back and help us out by commenting out the basics of the language.
